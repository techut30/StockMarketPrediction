## Overview

Stock market prediction is highly challenging due to the complex, non-linear, and high-dimensional nature of financial data. This project evaluates whether integrating quantum computing techniques with classical machine learning can significantly enhance predictive accuracy. Our quantum-enhanced model, built using PennyLane, achieved 94% accuracy compared to 81% for classical models.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Fetches historical stock data from the Alpha Vantage API and stores it as CSV files.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and enriches data by computing technical indicators (Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, etc.), applying noise reduction techniques (Savitzkyâ€“Golay filter), and generating lag features.
- **Classical ML Model:** Implements a Random Forest Regressor for benchmark predictions.
- **Quantum-Enhanced Model:** Utilizes variational quantum circuits (with RY rotations and CNOT gates) and the Adam optimizer to achieve superior prediction accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Implements a Flask API for predictions, containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes for scalability.
- **Comparative Analysis:** Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and overall accuracy.
